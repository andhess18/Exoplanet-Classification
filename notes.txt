1. One-Hot Encoding Categorical Columns:

Comment: #one-hot encode categorical columns (line 23)

Explanation: One-hot encoding is a method used to convert categorical data into a format that can be provided to machine learning algorithms to do a better job in prediction.

Example: Suppose you have a categorical column "Color" with values "Red", "Green", and "Blue". One-hot encoding will convert this single column into three columns (one for each possible value):

2. Standardizing Features:

Comment: #standardize features (line 26)

Explanation: Standardization is the process of scaling the features such that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is necessary because different features might have different scales, which can affect the performance of certain algorithms, especially those that rely on distances (like k-NN) or optimization methods (like gradient from neural networks)
